    <string name="reseña1">The priest Joaquín María Giraldo is considered the first pioneer of the region, even the original founder of the town. After the first settlements that occurred there, something very similar to what happened in the rest of the southwest of Antioquia, the search for gold, would happen with this community.

After the gold, the settlers arrived in the region until in 1887 a couple of them, the brothers Joaquín and Petrona Franco, decided to build in the region a chapel on a mountainous ridge that they called “Los Angeles”. They were accompanied by the aforementioned Father Joaquín María Giraldo, who until posterity would become an icon of the population, and who was the one who proposed the name "Angelópolis" for the recent foundation. That is how the name stayed forever.</string>
